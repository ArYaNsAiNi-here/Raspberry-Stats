## Raspberry Stats

Raspberry Stats is a project designed to monitor and display various system statistics of a Raspberry Pi. This tool provides real-time insights into the performance and health of your Raspberry Pi, presented in an easy-to-access format.


## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Keep track of key system metrics including:
  - CPU Usage
  - Memory Usage
  - Disk Space
  - And more!
- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly web interface built with HTML and CSS.
- **Customizable**: Extend or modify the monitoring capabilities to suit your needs.
- **Lightweight**: Designed to run efficiently on the limited resources of a Raspberry Pi.


## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Backend logic for gathering and processing system statistics.
- **HTML & CSS**: Frontend for displaying data via a web interface.
