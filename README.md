#Raspberry Stats
Raspberry Stats is a project designed to monitor and display various system statistics of a Raspberry Pi. This tool provides real-time insights into the performance and health of your Raspberry Pi, presented in an easy-to-access format.

#Features
1. **Real-time Monitoring:** Keep track of key system metrics including CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, and more.
2. **Web Interface:** A user-friendly web interface built with HTML and CSS for easy access to stats.
3. **Customizable:** Extend or modify the monitoring capabilities to suit your needs.
4. **Lightweight:** Designed to run efficiently on the limited resources of a Raspberry Pi.
   
#Technologies Used
1. **Python:** Backend logic for gathering and processing system statistics.
2. **HTML & CSS:** Frontend for displaying data via a web interface.
